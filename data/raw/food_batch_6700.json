If there is fever, it usually is not very high (less than 101\u00bfF/less than 38.5\u00bfC). Most people get better within 57 days. Some infections are very mild, but others are severe or even life-threatening. Around 510% of those diagnosed with Shiga-toxin producing E.coli infections develop a potentially life-threatening complication known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Signs that a person is developing HUS include decreased frequency of urination, feeling very tired, and losing pink color in cheeks and inside the lower eyelids. Persons with HUS should be hospitalized because their kidneys may stop working and they may develop other serious problems.
